# Breast-Cancer-Risk-Prediction-using-IBM-Auto-AI
Developing a machine learning model where in the model gets trained by considering the parameters such as: Radius ,Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Concavity, Concaveness, Compactness here all these parameters are taken in mean, se and overall values are been taken. And the model is been trained using Auto AI service in IBM Watson cloud and that can be deployed in an application such as web or mobile applications.
